> Example DAGs for users to refer to when writing their own

These are example DAGs for apache-airflow 

**NOTE**: Currently used by `dev` instance of Airflow (see [default values for `airflow-k8s` helm chart](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-helm-charts/blob/master/charts/airflow-k8s/values.yaml#L45))

### What is a DAG
In Airflow, a `DAG`—or a Directed Acyclic Graph—is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.

You can pass a kube2iam annotation to the PodOperator see the [assume role operator][kube2iam_example] for details.
